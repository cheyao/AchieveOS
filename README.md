I'm finally going to ship this!

I worked on this for 5 months 3 days (156 days) lol Not regeting it

# Why AchieveOS
AchieveOS is the future - ditch all of the bloatware. Starting at $99 per monthly license.

Edit after one year: Oh well I grossly overestimated my abilities, gotta relearn from scratch. Learning c++ atm, lets see where I am after a year.
