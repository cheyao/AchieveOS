# AchieveOS

This is NOT a linux distro, the contents are all made from zero (except for the asmlib)

Must install onto hard disk

### GPT partition UUIDs

I've defined some custom uuids, here is the list of UUIDs that I used:

| Name                | UUID                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| BIOS boot partition | 49464555-7349-7553-7065-724861726421 |
| HFS+ partition      | 6A898CC3-1DD2-11B2-99A6-080020736631 |
| SWAP partition      | 54776F48-536F-4157-504D-656D6F72793F |
