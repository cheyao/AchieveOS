Some notes for me (mostly or C17 specs, reading specs are hard XD)

Reserved identifiers:

All identifiers that begin with an underscore and either an uppercase letter or another under-
score are always reserved for any use, except those identifiers which are lexically identical to
keywords. <- ??????????
All identifiers that begin with an underscore are always reserved for use as identifiers with file
scope in both the ordinary and tag name spaces.
Each macro name in any of the following subclauses (including the future library directions)
is reserved for use as specified if any of its associated headers is included; unless explicitly
stated otherwise (see 7.1.4).
All identifiers with external linkage in any of the following subclauses (including the future
library directions) and errno are always reserved for use as identifiers with external linkage.188)
Each identifier with file scope listed in any of the following subclauses (including the future
library directions) is reserved for use as a macro name and as an identifier with file scope in
the same name space if any of its associated headers is included.
